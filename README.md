# Google Home Page

This is a google home page that I created and am still improving. It contains links to websites that I regularly use or find handy to have as a quick link. 


# SETUP
*For Google Chrome* 

1. Go to your Google Chrome settings page and click on the "Appearance" tab
2. Under the "Show home button" section click on the section that allows you to enter a custom address
3. Enter: "jmagdev1.github.io/Google-Home" into the input section. This will now set it as your home page for google
4. To set the page to load on startup click on the tab "On startup"
5. Under this section click on "Open a specific page or set of pages"
6. Here put the same address as before: "jmagdev1.github.io/Google-Home"
7. Congrats you are now using my custom Google Home Page!
